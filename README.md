# Naztronomy - Siril Script log analyzer

## Naztronomy-Smart_Telescope_PP.py

A comprehensive Python script that automates the preprocessing workflow for smart telescopes, including file conversion, registration, stacking, and SPCC color calibration.

**Supported Telescopes:**

- ZWO Seestar S30
- ZWO Seestar S50
- Dwarf 2
- Dwarf 3
- Celestron Origin

**Features:**

- Automatic batching for large datasets (>2000 files on Windows)
- Optional calibration frame support (darks, flats, biases)
- Automatic master frame creation from calibration files
- Drizzle integration for improved resolution
- Background extraction and filtering options
- Spectrophotometric Color Calibration (SPCC)
- Save/Load presets functionality

## Naztronomy-OSC_PP.py

An advanced OSC (One Shot Color) image preprocessing script designed for processing images from multiple sessions with full mosaic and alignment capabilities.

**Features:**

- Multi-session support with individual file management
- Automatic plate solving and mosaicking for images with proper headers
- Star alignment fallback for images without coordinates
- Session-based organization and processing
- Individual session stacking option in addition to merged stacks
- Master frame creation from single calibration files
- Preprocessed lights collection for later combination
- Experimental mono camera support (no debayering)
- Comprehensive filter settings for image quality control

## Installation

Two ways to install these scripts:

1. Place the Python `.py` files from this repository in your local Siril scripts directory
2. Install directly through Siril by going to **Scripts >> Get Scripts** in Siril and searching for "Naztronomy"

## System Requirements

- Siril 1.3.6 or later
- Python packages: PyQt6, numpy, astropy (automatically installed by the scripts)
- Recommended: Blank working directory for clean setup

## Usage Guidelines

### For Smart Telescope Script:

- Must have a `lights` subdirectory in your working directory
- Calibration frames are optional but recommended
- Supports automatic batching for large datasets
- SPCC requires local Gaia catalog for best results

### For OSC Processing Script:

- Can be run from any directory
- Supports multiple sessions with different frame types
- Images are copied/symlinked for processing (requires disk space)
- Individual sessions can be processed separately or combined
- Experimental mono mode bypasses debayering for monochrome cameras

## Limitations

- **Windows File Limit:** The `.ssf` scripts do not work with file counts > 2048 on Windows
- **OSC Optimization:** Current scripts are optimized for OSC cameras (mono support is experimental)
- **Disk Space:** OSC script copies files before processing, requiring additional storage

## Deprecated Scripts (.ssf files)

### Naztronomy-Seestar_Broadband_Mosaic.ssf

A legacy Siril script optimized for broadband (UV/IR block) filters. Automates stacking and mosaic creation for Seestar telescope images.

**⚠️ DEPRECATED:** This script is no longer actively supported. Please use the Python scripts above for new projects.

### Naztronomy-Seestar_Narrowband_Mosaic.ssf

A legacy Siril script tailored for narrowband (LP) filters, handling stacking and mosaic generation for Seestar telescope images.

**⚠️ DEPRECATED:** This script is no longer actively supported. Please use the Python scripts above for new projects.
